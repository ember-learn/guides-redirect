# guides-redirect
Netlify Redirect Config that links to the `release` guides

## Why does this repo exist?

We published a Netlify app to show the [Octane Guides Preview](https://octane-guides-preview.emberjs.com),
as part of the preparation for Octane. For SEO reasons, we need to maintain the redirect for this
URL that sends people to the published Guides. The Netlify deployment for this needs to be
kept/maintained. This repo contains the redirects.
